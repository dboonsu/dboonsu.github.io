<h2>12-Tone Music</h2>
<p>
    Mathematically, a note corresponds to a frequency measured in hertz (Hz) or vibrations per second. In concerts, orchestras will tune their
    instruments to a central note of A vibrating at 440 Hz. Suppose you doubled this note's frequency to 880 Hz. The resulting note would
    still be an A note at a higher pitch. Similarly, if you halved its frequency to 220 Hz, the result would be a lower pitched A.
    This rule of doubling and halving holds for any note.
</p>
<p>
    What about the notes in between? Because of math and the history of (especially Western) music, our ears have collectively decided that we
    should use 12 notes of fixed frequencies. The formula to calculate the frequency of a note where x is the distance in semitones is:
</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>
    Thus, we can calculate the frequencies for the notes in the 12-tone equal temperament system. These notes are A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F,
    F#, G, G#, and back to A. Astute observers will note that there is no B# or E#. The explanation for this is math and history. Technically,
    however, a B# would be the same pitch as C.
</p>

<h2>Duration</h2>
<p>
    Now that we understand the pitch of a note, we can discuss the duration aspect.
