A <b>staff</b> is a set of five lines and four spaces on which music can be written. Each line and space can represent a note.
<br />
<br />
Below is an example of a staff:
<br />
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/staff.png" alt="Five lines and four spaces: a staff." width="750px" height="300px">
<br />
<br />
How can we tell which lines and spaces represent which notes? Clefs!
