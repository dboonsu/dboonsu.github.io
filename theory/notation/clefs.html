Clefs are necessary to to indicate which lines and spaces on the staff represent which notes.

Take, for example, the treble clef. Also known as the G-clef, it rests upon the staff and tells musicians which notes are which.
From the bottom going upwards, the five lines represent the notes E, G, B, D, F, meaning the spaces represent F, A, C, E. The bottom
swirl of the G-clef encircles the note G.

The bass clef, or F-clef, rests upon the staff and maps lines and spaces to a different notes than the treble clef. From the bottom
going upwards, the five lines now represent the ntoes G, B, D, F, A and the spaces represent A, C, E, G. The note F is in between the 
two dots on the F-clef.
