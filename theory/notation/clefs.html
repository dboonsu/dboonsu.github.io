<p>Clefs are used to indicate which lines and spaces on the staff represent which notes.</p>

<h2>Treble Clef</h2>

        Take, for example, the treble clef. Also known as the G-clef, it rests upon the staff and tells musicians which notes are which.
        From the bottom going upwards, the five lines represent the notes E, G, B, D, F, meaning the spaces represent F, A, C, E. The bottom
        swirl of the G-clef encircles the note G.

<h2>Bass Clef</h2>
<div class="image-w-text">
    <p>
        The bass clef, or F-clef, rests upon the staff and maps lines and spaces to a different notes than the treble clef. From the bottom
        going upwards, the five lines now represent the notes G, B, D, F, A and the spaces represent A, C, E, G. The note F is in between the
        two dots on the F-clef.

<h2>Alto and Tenor Clef</h2>
<div class="image-w-text">
    <img class="left-fade-in" style="--animation-order: 2" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/clefs/tenor_clef.png" width="61px" height="84px">
    <p>
        The alto and tenor clef, or C-clef, are slightly less common clefs. From the bottom going upwards, the alto clef assigns the notes
        F, A, C, E, G to the lines going bottom-up and G, B, D, F to the spaces. The note C is in the middle of the C-clef. The two clefs
        use the same symbol but the alto clef is at a higher pitch.
