An interval is the distance between two notes. In Western music, the smallest distance between two notes is referred to as a <b>half step</b> or a <b>semitone</b>. For instance, the distance between C and C# is one half-step. It follows that two half steps, or the distance between C and D, is referred to as a <b>whole step</b> or a <b>tone</b>.
