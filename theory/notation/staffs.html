A <b>staff</b> is a set of five lines and four spaces on which music can be written. Notes can rest on each line or space.
<br />
<br />
Below is an example of a staff:
<br />
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/staff.png" alt="Five lines and four spaces: a staff." width="750px" height="300px">
<br />
<br />
A barebone staff alone does not tell us much, which is why we need clefs.
