Accidentals are used to raise or lower the pitch of a note. They can be used to access notes that would otherwise be unavailable or out of key.
To raise the pitch of a note, we have the sharp and double sharp symbols. The former raises pitch by a semitone, and the latter by a tone.
To lower the pitch of a note, we have the flat and double flat symbols. Similarly, the former lowers pitch by a semitone, and the latter by a tone.
Lastly, if a note has been indicated as sharp or flat, we can use the natural symbol which cancels any previous adjustments.
