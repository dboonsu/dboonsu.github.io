An interval is simply the distance between two notes. The smallest interval of two different notes is called a semitone (or half-step). The distance
of two semitones is commonly referred to as a tone (or whole-step). Other important intervals include unison, which is the distance from a note to itself,
and octaves, which is the same note at a higher or lower frequency. Finally, there is the tritone, which is an augmented fourth or diminished fifth.

Apart from measuring the distance of two notes, intervals can also have quality of perfect, minor, major, augmented, or diminished. The table below
outlines intervals and their qualities from unison to an octave.
